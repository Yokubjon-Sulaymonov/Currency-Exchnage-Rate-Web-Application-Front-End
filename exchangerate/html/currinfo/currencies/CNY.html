    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class = "simple-font">
      The Chinese yuan renminbi (simplified Chinese: 人民币), or CNY, which means ‘people's currency’, is the official
      currency of the People's Republic of China. The term ‘renminbi’ refers to the name of the currency while ‘yuan’
      refers to the basic unit of the Chinese currency. The symbol of the renminbi is ¥. As it is shared with the
      Japanese yen (JPY), CN¥ is sometimes used to distinguish the Chinese yuan renminbi from the yen.
    </p>
    <p class = "simple-font">
      The renminbi, introduced in 1948, is abbreviated as RMB but it is not an official currency code. Markets located
      in Hong Kong that trade the Chinese currency at free-floating rates use another unofficial code - CNH. The RMB
      acts as one of the most-held reserve currencies in the world, while being the eighth most-traded currency
      globally.
    </p>
    <p class = "simple-font">
      One yuan (Chinese: 元) is divided into ten jiao (Chinese: 角) and one jiao can be further divided into 10 fen
      (Chinese: 分). The notes of China’s currency are issued by China's central bank, the People's Bank of China
      (PBOC), in 10 denominations: ¥0.1, ¥0.2, ¥0.5, ¥1, ¥2, ¥5, ¥10, ¥20, ¥50 and ¥100. The renminbi coins come in 6
      denominations: ¥0.01, ¥0.02, ¥0.05, ¥0.1, ¥0.5 and ¥1.
    </p>
    <h3>Economy</h3>
    <ul class="simple-font">
      <li>The People’s Republic of China has a market-oriented economy, with the service sector accounting for almost
        52 percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP).</li>
      <li>In 2020, China was the second largest national economy by nominal GDP, with the country’s GDP being
        estimated at over US$14 trillion.</li>

        economy globally with growth rates averaging 10 percent over 30 years.</li>

        belong to the People’s Republic of China.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul class = "simple-font">
      <li>In 1948, the first edition of the Chinese yuan renminbi was introduced by the People's Bank of China, with
        the RMB issued in banknotes only.</li>
      <li>In 1955, a revaluation happened, resulting in the introduction of the new yuan renminbi at the exchange
        rate of 1 new yuan to 10,000 old yuan.</li>
      <li>Since the 1950s, numerous series of the Chinese currency have been issued, having their own banknotes and
        coins.</li>
      <li>In 1978, the dual track currency system was implemented, with the Chinese yuan renminbi being used only
        domestically. Therefore foreigners had to use exchange certificates, which led to a strong black market.</li>
      <li>In the 1990s, the dual track currency system was abandoned.</li>
      <li>From 1997 to 2005, the Chinese currency was pegged to the US dollar at the exchange rate of approximately
        1 USD to 8.3 CNY.</li>
      <li>Since 2006, the Chinese yuan renminbi has had a floating exchange rate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Trivia</h3>
    <ul class = "simple-font">
      <li>The word ‘yuan’ means ‘round’.</li>
      <li>The ‘redback’ is a nickname for the Chinese yuan renminbi, similarly to the slang term for the US
        dollar - ‘greenback’.</li>
      <li>China's central bank announced in 2019 that a digital renminbi, also called DCEP (Digital Currency
        Electronic Payment) was going to be released soon. However, China’s digital currency won’t be based on
        cryptocurrency</li>
